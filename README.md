====================

## Long description
In this rogue-like tower defense, you're an AI whose mission is to explore deep caves, collect valuable resources, and combat hostile alien creatures.

Welcome, 9H3B. As the overseer of mining operations in sector Zeta, your primary objective is to extract precious ores that lie hidden within the depths. However, be prepared to face formidable resistance from hazardous life forms lurking in the darkness. Your strategic prowess will be put to the test as you deploy mining bots, utilizing the resources you gather to strengthen your defenses.

Success in your mission holds the key to expanding our galactic presence. With each triumph, we can establish a stronger foothold in the vast reaches of the cosmos. The fate of our expansion rests in your hands, 9H3B!

Instructions
============
Left click in open areas to place a tower (it takes 25 ore).
Place towers directly next to ore deposits to collect (top, bottom, left, or right; no diagonals).
Each ore deposit contains 250 ore.
Towers can only be placed in areas that have been seen.
Arrow keys to move the camera.
Collect 10,000 excess ore to win the level.
When a tower is destroyed, it leaves a foundation behind; those foundations can't be built over but can be cleared to make the tile available again.
Click on a tower to select it; you can then upgrade it's damage, range, or rate of fire with the 1, 2, and 3 number keys respectively.
To sell a tower or clear a foundation, click on it and type "x".
Tip: You get back all the resources for the tower and upgrades, so it's better to sell towers before they are destroyed. You can also move towers this way.

The game does not currently have any progression, but the levels are procedurally generated.

The tilde key (or back tick key) can be used to turn on cheat mode. Further instructions are provided in game.
